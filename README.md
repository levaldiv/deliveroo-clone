# Responsive Deliveroo Clone Challenge

How's it going everyone! This here is a React Native Responsive Deliveroo Clone Challenge! I was tasked to create a semi-clone of the Deliveroo delivery app using React Native. This was definitely another challeging YET exciting build as it focused on TailwindCSS, React Native, Redux, and many more.

## Core Features

- Responsive (works well with mobile, medium and large devices)
- Used React Native Heroicons to elevate the app design
- Used React Native Navigation to navigate between screens
- Implemented Redux to add items to the user's basket and manage state
- Created queries using QROQQL to query information from sanity backend
- Used Sanity CMS to power the backend of the app
- Built a sleek animated checkout flow with an AWESOME UI/UX experience!
- With all that .. I hope you enjoy!
